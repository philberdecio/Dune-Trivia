## Getting Started

[Dune Trivia](https://philberdecio.github.io/Dune-Trivia/)

Click on the 'start' button to get started. Check the radio button for your chosen answer and click 'Submit.' You'll see whether you answered correctly or not. Then click the 'next' button to go to the next question.

## Next Steps

I plan to create a larger pool of questions, then choose from them at random to add variety to the game. I'd also like to polish up the game's UI.
